            One evening I was talking to a lady from another country and we were comparing
            how we say the same words differently. Besides our obvious distinctive timbres,
            the rise and fall of our voice made different shapes (inflections). I thought it
            would be neat to experiment with an app that visualized the different inflections
            and allowed people to quickly compare them.

            Currently whistling produces the best results. I'm slowly learning more about
            Digital Signal Processing and am trying to find a more accurate and more
            efficient pitch detection algorithm.

            To operate, hold 'f' or 'j' (left screen / right screen) and say the word.
            As soon as you are finished, release and wait until the image appears.
            The graph shows a familiar amplitude wave drawing with a black line that
            best guesses the contour of your sound.
