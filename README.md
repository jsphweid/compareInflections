The idea behind this app is that two people sitting at one computer can compare the pitch of their voice as they say words or short phrases.

Currently, the algorithm used to determine how the pitch changes isn't very good and only works decently with sounds that resemble a sine wave (I.E. a whistle). I'm currently learning more about digital signal processing in an effort to create a better algorithm.
